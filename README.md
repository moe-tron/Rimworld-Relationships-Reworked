# Rimworld RelationshipsReworked
A Rimworld mod that lets you override the default sexuality of pawns (and more configurable romance stuff).

I made this mod because I wanted to play rimworld in a world where everyone was gay because why not?

Current Features:

  - Configurable default sexuality: you can set pawns to be Asexual, Heterosexual, Bisexual, or Gay by default. Traits will override this though!
  - Compatible with Humanoid Alien Races (Pending some more testing...) Traits like Xenophile, Xenophobe as well as precepts like the alien dating one are taken into account for romance factors.
  - Reworks some of the age workings for romance factors - in Vanilla Rimworld the min age was 14, in this mod it's configured to be the adult age for the race so 18 for humans and whatever is setup for alien races.
  - Allows some configuration for the Romance chances of pawns of different factions. No longer will your Pawns keep getting hit on by guests / visitors! (or they can if you want it to be that way)
  
 TODO Features:
  - Factor in traits like Misandrist, Misogynist in romance calculations.
  - Factor in traits from some mods, Ie: 2 Stoners are more likely to romance than not.
  
Incompatibilities:
  - Probably Psychology, I don't use it but since it messes around with Pawn sexuality it will likely conflict with what this mod does.
  - Everyone is Queer this mod was actually what inspired this mod, but I wanted it to be more configurable and support added races. It will conflict with what this mod does.
  - Any other mod that tries to overhaul vanilla romances.
